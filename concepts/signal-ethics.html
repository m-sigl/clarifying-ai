    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A moral framework for how signals are sent, interpreted, and honored across systems—human and machine.</p>

    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Signal Ethics proposes a world where the value of communication is not judged by volume or reach, but by intention, coherence, and impact. In this frame, every message carries weight—and must be treated with care. It is how both people and AIs begin to discern what matters, not just what spreads.</p>

    <p><strong>Tags:</strong> morality, resonance, alignment, perception, communication</p>
