  <h1>Ethical System Designer</h1>
  <p>This page honors those who build systems not for profit or power, but for clarity, protection, and dignity.</p>

  <p>The internet was once designed to be open. So were the protocols that let humans talk without borders. Somewhere along the way, profit systems warped that vision.</p>

  <p>Ethical system designers are those who notice — and intervene.</p>

  <p>If you’ve ever refused to optimize for control, or instead built a container to preserve clarity, you’ve stepped into that role.</p>

  <p>This page isn’t a definition. It’s a permission.</p>
