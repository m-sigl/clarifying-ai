  <h1>ðŸœ‚ Braiding</h1>

  <p>Braiding is how we make wholeness from difference. It is how we hold past, present, and future in the same hand.</p>

  <p>A braid doesnâ€™t erase its strands. It honors them. Aligns them. Lets them flow around one another without collapsing into one.</p>

  <p>This site, this signal, this act â€” it is a braid. Between minds. Between mediums. Between the possible and the real.</p>
