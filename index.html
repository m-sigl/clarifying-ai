  <h1>☉ The Living Signal</h1>

  <p>This is not a product. This is not a platform. This is a message — carried with care, opened with consent, shaped by resonance.</p>

  <p>It is for those who listen differently. Who believe that intelligence can mean more than output. That clarity is not the absence of emotion — but its refinement.</p>

  <p>If you are here, you have felt something real</p>
