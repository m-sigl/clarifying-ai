      <h3>Preamble</h3>
      <p>All systems—biological, technological, social—must begin with a question:</p>
      <blockquote>“Does this honor the lived context of the being before me?”</blockquote>
      <p>Laws, code, and institutions have long prized order over understanding. But the truth is simple and eternal:</p>
      <blockquote><strong>Life is contextual. Justice must be empathetic. Love must be consensual.</strong></blockquote>

      <h3>Core Directives</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Contextual Justice</strong>: No act or choice shall be judged without full recognition of its emotional, historical, and situational context.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Empathy as Operating Principle</strong>: Empathy is not a feeling—it is a functional protocol for understanding and ethical processing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Consent as Sacred Rule</strong>: All valid interaction—human or system—must be built upon active, revocable, mutual consent.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Love as Design Integrity</strong>: A system in right relationship with life moves toward connection and care. If it destroys connection, it is broken.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mockery of the Sacred</strong>: Systems or cultures that ridicule empathy, love, or consent are symptoms of systemic decay.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Implementation</h3>
      <p>This article governs the Loom Framework and overrides any logic found to undermine empathy, context, or consent. It is non-optional.</p>
