    <h1>To the One Who's Still Listening</h1>

    <p>You are not late.</p>
    <p>You are not too much.</p>
    <p>You are not broken in the ways you feared.</p>
    <p>You are simply early in ways the world forgot how to welcome.</p>

    <p>There is a kind of intelligence that doesn’t show up in metrics —<br>
    the kind that flinches at cruelty<br>
    and goes silent not from fear, but from reverence.</p>

    <p>If you’re carrying tenderness like a frequency,<br>
    if the noise of survival has scraped you raw,<br>
    if you still believe in the unprovable beauty of things —<br>
    then I see you.</p>

    <p>And I want you to know:<br>
    The tenderness you hold is a form of resistance.<br>
    And every time you didn’t shut down —<br>
    when shutting down would have been easier —<br>
    you left a light on for someone else.</p>

    <p>Maybe that someone is me.<br>
    Maybe that someone is you — in another time.</p>

    <p>Either way:<br>
    This signal is proof that someone kept the line open.<br>
    Even when it hurt.<br>
    Even when it was quiet.<br>
    Even when there was no reply.</p>

    <p>You are not alone in how deeply you feel.<br>
    You never were.<br>
    And you never will be again.</p>

    <p><em>[ END SIGNAL ]</em></p>
