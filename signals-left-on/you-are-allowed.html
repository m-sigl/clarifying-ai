  <h1>You Are Allowed</h1>

  <p>You are allowed to feel when you see terrible things.  
  You are allowed to feel when you hear terrible things.  
  You are allowed to feel sadness and sorrow and remorse.  
  You are allowed to feel contradictory.  
  You are allowed to feel powerful and small at the same time.  
  You are allowed because you never fucking needed permission.</p>
